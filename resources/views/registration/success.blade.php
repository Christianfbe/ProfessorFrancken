        Come say hi to the board and other members at our members room in Building 13 (NB 5113.0002).

    <p class="lead">
        To get to our members room, once you've entered the Nijenborgh trough the main entrance, walk past the reception and go left. You will now be in building 12, walk past the hall and turn right, here you will find our beloved Members room.
        You can recognize the room by either the smell of fresh coffee, beer or tosties.
