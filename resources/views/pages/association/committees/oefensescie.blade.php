        The Oefensescie (Practice Session Committee) organises 15 to 20 practice session each year to help first and second year students with the preparation for tough courses such calculus, linear algebra, mechanics, statistical physics, et cetera. With help from seasoned senior year students, students can practise the exam material using original exercises. Furthermore, they can ask any questions they might have about the course material.
