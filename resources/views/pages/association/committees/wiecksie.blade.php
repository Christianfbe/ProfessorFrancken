            </h1>

            <p>
                Because 5 days of Francken per week isn’t always enough for everyone, for those people there are the members weekends. What can be better then a weekend of relaxation and beer with fellow Francken members? The Wiecksie takes this need seriously and organises two weekends per year full of entertainment.
