        The Bincie, or the Dutch Field Trip Committee, aims to organize several field trips a year to companies or research centres in the Netherlands. Mini-field trips to departments are also organized to enable you to have a look at future internship places. Nowadays the Dutch Field Trip Committee also organizes some lunchtime lectures.
