    <h1>Control Engineering, the new next thing</h1>
    <p>A bit more than a year after my previous blog, it is time for an update. Since this is my second blog, following the 1-2 tradition rule, I now have a steady series going on. Since every series has a common thread, this one can’t be missing out. With these blogs I want to share my experiences as a PhD-student and give you an insight in the science which is conducted at the other end of the building. In this series I will introduce you to a field which you won’t encounter that often as a physicist. </p>
    <p>Last time I wrote, I was at the precipice of my PhD-research, now I am already one year into my adventure. The first conclusion I can make is that time has not stood still. In a desperate attempt to remove all connections with business and management, the institute for which I work has changed names: from ITM (Institute for Technology and Management) to ENTEG (ENgineering and TEchnology institute Groningen). Whether or not this has worked, I do not know. What I do know however is that TBK (or IEM) is still here. But let’s not dwell on these minor matters.</p>
