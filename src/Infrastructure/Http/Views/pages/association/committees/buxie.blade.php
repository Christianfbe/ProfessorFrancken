                Buixie (Foreign Field Trip Committee)
            </h1>

            <p>
                Every year, at the end of the third examination period, the Buixie, or the Foreign Field Trip Committee, organizes a trip to a European country. In 2014 we went to Scotland and last year we even went to India for our lustrum excursion! Various activities take place during the trip, including visits to companies and universities to give the participants some idea of what goes on in the world of applied physics outside Groningen. At least one case study has to be carried out for the trip: this is usually arranged by one of the Association´s sponsors.
