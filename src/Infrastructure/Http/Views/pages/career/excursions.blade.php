        <h3>Masters of Engineering lecture <small>December 3</small></h3>
        <p>
            Ever wondered how an oil & gas operator can safely drill to over five kilometers depth to hit a fifty square meter target? What technologies are involved and what considerations come into play? How is it possible to drill horizontally or offshore in deep-water environments? A Well Engineer develops, plans, costs, schedules and supervises the operations necessary to the process of drilling oil and gas wells, from initial well design to testing, completion and ultimately abandonment. They work with other professionals, such as geologists and geoscientists, to monitor drilling progress, oversee safety management and ensure the protection of the environment.

        <h3>TMC ‘Physics of Pong’ <small>November 24</small></h3>
        <p>
            Lecture, where we will dive in the interesting world about pong and the behaviour of pingpong balls. So maybe this will give you some last moment insights for the beer pong tournament that will be held afterwards! During the lecture there will be drinks and snacks. Don’t forget to sign up at the Franckenroom and we hope to see you!
