                Fraccie (Activity Committee)
            </h1>

            <p>
                A Franckenmember is supposed to be in good condition. Fortunately there is a committee that takes responsibility for this. The Fraccie takes care of the state of our ears, eyes, minds, livers and senses, so that our Franckenmembers remain their beauty. The training schedule consists among other things movie nights, the yearly jam session, members weekends, the poker competition and the Christmas dinner. Keep an eye on the posters and sign up at the form on the Franckendoor.
