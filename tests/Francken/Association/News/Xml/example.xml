		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The novel design, through chemical engineering, of semiconductor polymers in recent years has given new breadth to the organic photovoltaics (OPV) technology. This pushed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to a record 11.5 % and 13.2 % for single junction and tandem devices respectively. While this achievement is a boost to the field, the device stability remains still a challenge. It has already been established in the group that indeed the chemical structure plays a crucial role in the UV-degradation of the cells. This proposed research work is intended to extend further this understanding and show if any, the role played by the presence of O and F atoms in the side chains of these novel polymers on the stability of their solar cells. <br><br>
For this master project, first the student must have basic knowledge of organic solar cells and must be ready to work both in the cleanroom environment, making solar cells,  and measurement lab, where all equipment are readily available, for their characterisation.<br><br>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) has attracted widespread attention in the materials community over the last decade because it exhibits fascinating electronic and optoelectronic properties as outlined in several comprehensive reviews <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2"></a></sup>. MoS2 is usually grown by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) on Si/SiO2; it can be used and studied on Si/SiO2 or after transfer to other substrates. 

Two-dimensional MoS2 sheets often exhibit a perfect lattice over large areas but sulphur vacancies are also common both in the sheet and at the sheet edges; S vacancies are in fact crucial for catalysis <sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. Grafting molecules to the surface of such a 2D crystal changes the electronic and optical properties because the attached molecules influence the electronic structure of MoS2. Scanning tunneling microscopy studies of the adsorption of dibenzothiophene (DBT) on single-layer MoS2 offered the first direct evidence that it is possible to induce covalent bonding of DBT to MoS2 <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. <br>
The purpose of this bachelor project is to study whether one can achieve at the same time a healing of S-defects in a MoS2 monolayer and a change of its optical properties by adsorbing alkane thiol. <br><br>
The student will first create a higher than usual amount of S vacancies by heating the MoS2 monolayer grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) on Si/SiO2 above 200 °C. Then the sample will be immersed into an alkane thiol solution to induce alkane thiol adsorption and hence filling of these vacancies. The success of the attachment will be verified by water contact angle measurements and with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A change of the optical properties of MoS2 will be revealed by UV-Vis Spectroscopy. <br><br>

MoS2 is usually grown by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) on Si/SiO2, however several envisioned applications and fundamental investigations require either freestanding films suspended on metal grids or MoS2 on conducting substrates, and hence a good transfer method is crucial. Some conventional methods to transfer MoS2 from Si/SiO onto another substrate require long C-chain polymer, which need to be etched away by hazardous chemicals such as HF. These methods leave polymer residues on the MoS2 layer or decrease electron mobility due to defects created in the aggressive etching process. <br><br>

In this BSc project, the student will investigate a new MoS2 transfer method employing using a water-soluble polymer, which can easily remove by dissolving in water hence is expected to preserve the good quality of MoS2 after transfer. The student will optimize the transfer protocol, learn various characterisation techniques (Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Photoelectron spectroscopy) and compare the properties of MoS2 transferred by the new method and by the standard protocol using HF.<br><br>

### Acknowledgements
This blog could not have been written if it weren’t for jolly Francken members, beer and Wikipedia.
Bedrankt!

## Introduction
Many a mathematician, physicist or even astronomer may have heard the name: Borel (be sure to
get the emphasis right). On a Monday afternoon, some Franckenmembers decided they wanted to
find out who this Borel was, mostly because his name sounded so appealing to us. He was known for
the Heine-Borel theorem in real analysis (reëel) and the Borel-Weil- Bott theorem in group theory. We
were surprised to find that we were not dealing with a single Borel! The Heine-Borel theorem and
the Borel-Weil- Bott theorem do not descend from the same mathematician! The Borels who did this
are Émile Borel and Armand Borel, respectively. In further research, we found that both of them
were very ingenious and intelligent men, who contributed a lot to various aspects of mathematics
and physics. I was bored enough and thought this subject has just the right level of relevance to write
a blog about. This blog is dedicated to these Borels and all the surprisingly appropriate things we can
do with their work and their surname. Hoogh!

## Émile Borel

![Émile Borel](/images/news/borel-borel-borel/emile-borel.jpg)

### Life and achievements
If we have to celebrate Borels in some order, we might as well stick to chronological order. Émile
Borel (1871-1956) was born in Saint-Affrique, Aveyron in France. At age 18, Borel won the concours
générale, a prestigious French academic competition. He then went on to study mathematics,
resulting in the thesis “On some points in the theory of functions”, a very specific title. Borel
subsequently managed to publish 22 papers in his four years as a lecturer at the university of Lille.
Borel was an extraordinarily clever man. When he was thirty, he married a 17 year old girl.
Furthermore, you may know him from a number of results.
He most notably proved the Heine-Borel theorem, together with Eduard Heine, which is elementary
in real analysis. They proved (although we are convinced that Borel did the real work) that a subset
of some Cartesian power of the set of real numbers $(\mathbb{R}^n)$ is compact if and only if it is
closed and bounded. The RUG docent Arthemy Kiselev had a quite ingenious twist on this theorem.
Roughly in his words: “You might say to a girl: ‘you are very compact’, and she would reply: ‘Is it
because I am petite?’ Then you could say: ‘No. It is because you are closed in character and bounded
in intellect.’” Gerjan Wielink turned this analogy around: “You might say to a girl: ‘you are definitely
not compact’, and she would reply: ‘Is it because I am open in character or unbounded in intellect?’
Then you could say: ‘No. You’re fat.’” And then some say mathematicians don’t have a sense of
humour!
In case physicists stopped reading: Borel was a physicist! He originally laid the connection between
hyperbolic geometry and special relativity.
On top of everything, Borel had a political career. Not only was he responsible for PIS (Paris Institute
of Statistics), he has also been the French minister of marine. He was a proud member of the French
resistance during the Second World War.
Sadly, Borel passed away, just more than 61 years ago, at age 85, in Paris. May he rest in fertile
ground, and may we ever generate inspiration from his talent, wisdom and surname.

### The Bor(r)el distribution
Borel did even more than the results described above: he was the first to publish on game theory,
and (co-)produced Borel’s lemma, Borel’s law of large numbers (Francken members are familiar with
an analogous borrel law), the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox, the Borel-Cantelli lemma, the Borel-
Cadthéodory theorem, the Borel summation and, last but not least, the Borel distribution. The Borel
distribution, given by $$P_\mu(n)=\frac{e^{-\mu n}(\mu n)^{n-1}}{n!},$$ is shown below, for $\mu$
varying from $0$ to $1$. I made it in MATLAB.

{: class="img-fluid"}
![Borrel distribution](/images/news/borel-borel-borel/borrel-distribution.png)

This Borel distribution is strikingly similar to another distribution: the well-known borrel distribution
corresponding to the Franckenroom, which can be found on page 146 of our latest lustrumbook
. Note that $P(X=n)$ means you drink at least $n$ : if you drink $2$ beers, this also counts as
drinking $1$ beer. That explains the strict decreasing of the curve. Sjoerd Meesters found an
explanation for the shape of this curve, but it also follows straightforwardly from the Borel
distribution. Concidence? Not a real option. We may conclude that our drinking problem is well-
conditioned: it behaves sufficiently in accordance with the Borel distribution. How very netses of us.
A question one might ask is what the parameter $\mu$ means. The answer to this question is that
$\mu$ is a measure for how uniform our drinking is. Suppose we have two members who drink the
same number of beers per year (The Borel distribution has been normalized, such that the subject
drinks one beer per day on average), and suppose one of them has a smaller $\mu$-value. Then that
person usually drinks a few beers, and does so on many distinct days. An extreme case is $\mu = 0$,
implying that the member drinks precisely one beer every day. The other member does not drink on
many days, but when he does, escalation is guaranteed. Looking at the distribution in the
lustrumbook, we conclude that Francken as a total has a fairly large $\mu$-value. I would estimate
$\mu \approx 0.8$. This is plausible: on many days, for instance weekend days, few or no beers are
drunk, and a greater number of beers is consumed on some scarce occasions, such as Borrels.
Mark Redeman has been ingenious enough to derive a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) from
anyone’s given streepstatistics. Very cool! This MLE is surprisingly simple: $$\hat{\mu}_{MLE} =
1 - \frac{1}{\bar{x}},$$ where $\bar{x}$ is the average number of beers drunk on a day at which the
person drinks at least one beer. Using this formula, he managed to calculate the $\mu$-value of
some individuals as well as that of the entire association. Which as of this writing is equal
to $0.977$.

I suggest that we introduce this $\mu$-value as a prominent property of the drinking behavior of any
(group of) people. In my opinion, the $\mu$-value of the entire association should always be
presented at a general assembly. Furthermore, the idea that borrelcie.vodka/jij or
[professorfrancken.nl/profile](https://professorfrancken.nl/profile) would show not only a member’s raw streepstatistics, but his or her
$\mu$-value, makes me very excited. Imagine a Borelaar shouting, at the start of some borrel: “I’m
going to raise my $\mu$-value by 0.02 tonight!” upon starting a game of Chwazi. The future is here,
people.

## Armand Borel

Another kneitse Borel was Armand Borel. Armand Borel (1923-2003) was a Swiss mathematician. His
work finds its place more in pure mathematics than in applied mathematics and physics. However,
the puns related to his surname are incredible! Borel began his mathematical career under the
supervision of Heinz Hopf, a German mathematician. Hopf may be seen as the very beginning, origin
and catalyst of Borel. His first significant contribution was in collaboration with Jacques Tits, a
Belgian-born French mathematician. Many of you may have seen Tits: he is well-known for
introducing Tits buildings, the Tits alternative and the Tits group. In general, mathematicians have
the greatest respect for Tits. Another important reason for this is Tits’ hard work on the Coxeter
number, Coxeter group and Coxeter graph.
Borel did important work in proving the Borel-Weil- Bott-theorem and then co-devised the Borel-
Moore homology theory. Although the latter may sound more like a real commandment, it is actually
a homology theory for locally compact spaces. Appearances can be deceptive.
Borel was extraordinarily influential. He was even considered praiseworthy enough to be awarded a
real Brouwer medal. This medal was named after the famous Dutch mathematician Luitzen Egbertus
Jan Brouwer, who is known for proving the Hairy Ball Theorem and for founding Intuitionism in the
philosophy of mathematics.
Borel seemed to have lived his whole life in order for us to make funny jokes about his surname. The
people he made part of his biography constitute precisely what any given Borel needs. However, his
adtchievements in mathematics prove that he was more than a surname: he was _reëel_.

## Are Borel and Borel related?
Émile Borel was particularly quiet about the question whether he was related to Armand Borel. A
plausible explanation for that is that Borel never knew of the existence of Armand Borel. The other
way around was entirely different, in that sense: Borel knew that Émile Borel was also a famous
scientist. It was hence consistently a question to Borel whether Borel was related to him. Borel’s
replies to these questions were not very consistent. Borel sometimes stated that Borel and Borel are
not related, and at other occasions he claimed that he was Borel’s nephew.

## Conclusion
This blog undoubtedly leads us to conclude that scientific progress and Borels are inseparable! By
that I do not mean that a countable basis exists for neither, but that they are time invariantly and
irreversibly intertwined. If Borels never existed, that would have at the very least caused a severe
delay in the progress of mathematics and physics. We should be proud of how Francken contributes
to the science-catalyzing phenomenon of Borels. Borel on, twenty diamonds!
